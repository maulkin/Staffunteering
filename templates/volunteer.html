<p>Any help you can give us is warmly welcomed, whether it's a few hours or the whole festival. We're open to the public from {{ festival.open_start|date('l F j') }} until {{ festival.open_end|date('l F j') }}. For setting up and taking down we'll be looking for volunteers all the way from {{ festival.site_start|date('l F j') }} right through to {{ festival.site_end|date('l F j') }}.</p>

<p>As a volunteer you get free food, some free beer and can buy more beer at a reduced price - whilst you're working.</p>

<form method="POST" action="">

{{ forms.textarea("Do you have any particular qualifications or experience that would be relevant?", "qual", "", 2, 80) }}

<p>Please indicate the sessions you can work. If you can only work part of a session that's OK too.</p>
